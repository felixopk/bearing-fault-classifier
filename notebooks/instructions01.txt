# Key sections to include:

## 1. Load and Visualize Raw Signals
- Plot time-domain signals for each fault type
- Compare normal vs faulty bearings visually
- Check signal lengths, sampling rates

## 2. Statistical Analysis
- Calculate basic statistics (mean, std, min, max)
- Identify signal characteristics
- Check for data imbalances

## 3. Frequency Analysis
- Apply FFT to visualize frequency components
- Compare frequency spectra across fault types
- Identify dominant frequencies

## 4. Signal Quality Check
- Check for missing values
- Identify outliers
- Assess signal-to-noise ratio
